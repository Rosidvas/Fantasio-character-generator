# Fantasio-character-generator
using an API to create a character origin

This project is my attempt at developing an API using Javascript and Node.js .
## What it does
This starts as a simple website with a button. When the button is Click, the API begins to
request for random responses for each category. It will then give the user their character's
information such as name, place of origin and skills by displaying them on the website itself.

### Required in this project
 * Node.js
